CRUD functionality, but using mockAPI
performing Creta, Read, Update, and Delete Operations.

Step 1 -  An action is performed on the front-end (let’s say a button click)
Step 2 – That action is dispatched (by using useDispatch hook) to the middleware “createAsyncThunk()” written inside slice file
Step 3 – Inside createAsyncThunk() an API is made, using fetch or Axios, depending upon the method ie. GET, POST, DELETE, OR PUT
Step 4 – Now the response from the above is handled by the extraReducer , written inside createSlice method
Step 5 – And finally the state (or the global store) is updated
Step 6 – The store data is displayed back to frontend using useSelector hook

Packages used - reduxjs/toolkit
For CSS - Booststrap 5.0
